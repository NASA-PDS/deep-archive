Generate an Archive Information Package (AIP) and a Submission Information
Package (SIP). This creates three files for the AIP in the current directory
(overwriting them if they already exist):
‚ë† a "checksum manifest" which contains MD5 hashes of *all* files in a product
‚ë° a "transfer manifest" which lists the "lidvids" for files within each XML
  label mentioned in a product
‚ë¢ an XML label for these two files.

It also creates two files for the SIP (also overwriting them if they exist):
‚ë† A "SIP manifest" file; and an XML label of that file too. The names of
  the generated files are based on the logical identifier found in the
  bundle file, and any existing files are overwritten. The names of the
  generated files are printed upon successful completion.
‚ë° A PDS XML label of that file.

The files are created in the current working directory when this program is
run. The names of the files are based on the logical identifier found in the
bundle file, and any existing files are overwritten. The names of the
generated files are printed upon successful completion.
