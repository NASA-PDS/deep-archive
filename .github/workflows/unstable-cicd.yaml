# 🏃‍♀️ Continuous Integration and Delivery: Unstable
# =================================================
#
# Note: for this workflow to succeed, the following secrets must be installed
# in the repository:
#
# ``ADMIN_GITHUB_TOKEN``
#     A personal access token of a user with collaborator or better access to
#     the project repository. You can generate this by visiting GitHub →
#     Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Generate new
#     token. Give the token scopes on ``repo``, ``write:packages``,
#     ``delete:packages``, ``workflow``, and ``read:gpg_key``.
# ``TEST_PYPI_USERNAME``
#     Username for test.pypi.org.
# ``TEST_PYPI_PASSWORD``
#     Password for ``TEST_PYPI_USERNAME``.
