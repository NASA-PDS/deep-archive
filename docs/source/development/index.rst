üë©‚Äçüíª Development
=================

The quickest way to get started developing this package is to clone it and
build it out::

    git clone https://github.com/NASA-PDS-Incubator/pds-deep-archive.git
    cd pds-deep-archive
    python3 bootstrap.py
    bin/buildout

At this point, you'll have the ``pds-deep-archive``, ``aipgen``, ``sipgen``
programs ready to run as ``bin/pds-deep-archive``, ``bin/aipgen``, and
``bin/sipgen`` that's set up to use source Python code under ``src``.
Changes you make to the code are reflected in ``bin/sipgen`` immediately.

The documentation is in ``docs/source``, formatted as reStructuredText_ and
structured with Sphinx_.  To build the HTML from the documentation, run
``bin/docbuilder``. It will write HTML output to ``build/docs/html``.

You can also build local distributions or run any ``setuptools`` command via
the buildout refrain::

    bin/buildout setup . --help-commands

Commits back to GitHub will trigger workflows in GitHub Actions_ that
re-publish the project website_ as well as send artifacts to the testing_
Python Package Index. (The official Python Package Index gets updated only
with official release tags.)


Testing
-------

The code base finally includes unit and functional tests. Once you've built
out, you can run the entire test suite easily with::

    bin/test

If you'd like to integrate test data output with a CI/CD system such as
Jenkins_, add the ``--xml`` option to make a machine-readable reports in the
``parts/test`` directory.  Try ``bin/test --help`` for lots of other options.


..  note::

    Integration testing is not yet implemented, but could be if the need
    arises.


Making Releases
---------------

As mentioned in the parenthetical above, the official Python Package Index is
updated with an official release of this software is created with a release tag.
To ensure coherency with the GitHub release, first update the file

    src/pds/aipgen/version.txt

and enter the release version number you'd like to appear when running the
commands with ``--version`` and on the official Python Package Index.  Commit
and push this, then, on GitHub (and with appropriate permissions), visit:

    https://github.com/NASA-PDS-Incubator/pds-deep-archive/releases/new

and enter a release tag with the same version number plus any release notes.
This will trigger a GitHub Actions release to the official PyPI ü§û.
