===================

The PDS Deep Archive is a Python_ based package providing utilities for
handling *deep* archives. It includes software for Archive Information Package
(AIP) and Submission Information Package (SIP) products, based on Open
Archival Information System (OAIS_) standards.

creates Submission Information Packages (SIPs) from PDS bundles.
