PDS Deep Archive
===================

The PDS Deep Archive is a Python_ based package providing utilities for
handling *deep* archives. It includes software for Archive Information Package
(AIP) and Submission Information Package (SIP) products, based on Open
Archival Information System (OAIS_) standards.

Currently, this package provides three executable programs:

•  ``pds-deep-archive``, primary executable for creating both Archive
   Information Packages (AIPs) and Submission Information Packages (SIPs); and
•  ``aipgen``, a subcomponent of ``pds-deep-archive`` to create Archive
   Information Packages (AIPs); and
•  ``sipgen``, a subcomponent of ``pds-deep-archive`` to create Submission
   Information Packages (SIPs)

from PDS bundles.
