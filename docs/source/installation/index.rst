ðŸ“¦ Installation
===============

This section describes how to install the PDS Deep Archive. Because the
instructions vary markedly based on platform, it's divided into two
sections:

â€¢ Unix and Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS
â€¢ Windows systems


Unix and Unix-Like Systems
--------------------------

Follow the instructions in this section to install the Deep Archive software
onto Unix and Unix-like systems. This includes operating systems such as
Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, etc., as well as Apple Macintosh systems
running macOS.

For users of Windows systems, see the next section, below.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to installing this software, ensure your system meets the following
requirements:

â€¢  Python_ 3. This software requires Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11.  Python 2 will
   absolutely *not* work, and indeed Python 2 came to its end of life on the
   first of January, 2020.  Run ``python --version``, or ``python3 --version``,
   to check what is installed.
â€¢  ``libxml2`` version 2.9.2; later 2.9 versions are fine.  Run ``xml2-config
   --version`` to find out.
â€¢  ``libxslt`` version 1.1.28; later 1.1 versions are OK too.  Run
   ``xslt-config`` to see.

Consult your operating system instructions or system administrator to install
the required packages. For those without system administrator access and are
feeling anxious, you could try a local (home directory) Python_ 3 installation
using Miniconda_.


Doing the Installation on Unix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Some things to be aware of regarding examples below:

    â€¢ The octothorp characters ``#`` below indicate comments and need not be
      typed in.

    â€¢ The location of where you choose to create a Python virtual environment
      is entirely your preference.

    â€¢ The examples below should be seen only as suggestions. Invoking command
      lines below are demonstrative.

    â€¢ Please consult your system documentation for the appropriate invocations
      for your operating system, command shell (or "terminal"), and so forth.

The easiest way to install this software is to use Pip_, the Python Package
Installer. If you have Python on your system, you probably already have Pip;
you can run ``pip --help`` or ``pip3 --help`` to check.

It's best install the PDS Deep Archive into a `virtual environment`_ so it
won't interfere withâ€”or be interfered byâ€”other packages.  To do so::

    # Example assumes bash command shell. For others, consult shell documentation.
    mkdir -p $HOME/.virtualenvs
    python3 -m venv $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive
    source $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive/bin/activate
    pip3 install pds.deeparchive

You can then run ``pds-deep-archive --help`` or
``pds-deep-registry-archive --help`` to get a usage message and ensure
it's properly installed.

..  note::

    The above commands will install last approved release from the Python
    Package Index ("Cheeseshop_"). The latest, cutting edge release is posted
    at the Test Package Index, but these releases may not be fully confirmed
    to be operational. If you like taking risks, run the following to create a
    new virtual environment and install the latest development version of the
    software::

      mkdir -p $HOME/.virtualenvs
      python3 -m venv $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive
      source $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive/bin/activate
      pip3 install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple`` pds.deeparchive


Windows Installation
--------------------

To install the Deep Archive software on Windows comprises the following steps:

1. Installing Python 3.11 for Windows
2. Creating a "virtual environment" to contain an isolated instance of Python 3.11
3. Installing LXML 4.9.0 for Python 3.11 into the virtual environment
4. Installing the PDS Deep Archive into the virtual environment

The remainder of this section details these steps.


Installing Python for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python 3.11 (and specifically Python 3.11â€”no later or earlier versions will
work) will need to be installed onto your Windows system. There are several
ways to get Python 3.11:

â€¢ The "Microsoft Store" app
â€¢ Directly from https://python.org/
â€¢ Using Anaconda_ 
â€¢ Using Miniconda_

Use whatever is the most familiar to you. If you're not sure, the Microsoft
Store app is probably the easiest. To use the Microsoft Store to install
Python 3.11, do the following:

1. In the Windows taskbar's search box or Start Menu, open Microsoft Store.
2. In the search box at the top, type ``Python 3.11``
3. In the list of matching results, press the "Get" button next to Python 3.11.

.. tip::

    If you're on a managed system, you may need to ask your system
    administrator to install Python 3.11 for you.

Next, confirm that it's properly installed by opening Windows PowerShell and
starting Python 3.11 from the command-line. Use the Windows taskbar search
box or Start Menu to launch Windows PowerShell, then type ``python3.11`` and
press Enter.

.. note::

    If you installed Python from https://python.org/ or using Anaconda or
    Miniconda, the command you enter may be ``python3`` or even simply
    ``python`` instead of ``python3.11``.

.. tip::

    If entering the ``python3`` or ``python`` commands opens the Microsoft
    Store instead, you may need to turn off "application execution aliases".
    To do so, open the Settings app, choose Apps â†’ Advanced App Settings â†’
    App Execution Aliases. In this list, look for "App Installer
    ``python.exe``" and "App Installer ``python3.exe``" and slide both
    switches to "off".

Once you see Python's ``>>>`` prompt, press CTRL+Z then press Enter to exit
Python.


Creating the "Virtual Environment"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python supports the notion of "virtual environments", which are small
installations of Python that are isolated from the system's installation.
This enables you to install software for different Python applications without
interfering dependencies or conflicts. We recommend creating a virtual
environment for the Deep Archive software.

To do so, open Windows PowerShell (as above) and at the prompt, type the
following command (then press Enter)::

    python3.11 -m venv pds

.. note::

    If you installed Python from https://python.org/ or using Anaconda or
    Miniconda, you may need to replace ``python3.11`` with ``python3`` or
    even simply ``python``.

This will create a subfolder in the current directory called ``pds`` which
contains the virtual environment. Next, you'll need to "activate" the virtual
environment by entering the following command (then press Enter)::

    .\pds\Scripts\activate.ps1

Your PowerShell prompt will change to show ``(pds)`` at the front, indicating
that the virtual environment is now active.


Installing LXML 4.9.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because the Deep Archive manipulates and parses XML files, the "LXML" API for
Python must now be installed into the virtual environment. In the same
Windows PowerShell with the ``(pds)`` prompt, enter the following command
(then press Enter)::

    pip install https://download.lfd.uci.edu/pythonlibs/archived/lxml-4.9.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl

This will download and install LXML version 4.9.0 for Python 3.11 for 64-bit
Intel/AMD processors for Windows.


Installing PDS Deep Archive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, you can install the PDS Deep Archive. As of this writing, version
1.1.5 or later is recommended for Windows. To install it, enter the following
command in the same Windows PowerShell with the ``(pds)`` prompt (then press
Enter)::

    pip install pds.deeparchive~=1.1.5

Feel free to change the version number in the command as needed.

You can then run ``pds-deep-archive --help`` or
``pds-deep-registry-archive --help`` to get a usage message and ensure
it's properly installed.


Upgrading the Software
----------------------

To check and install an upgrade to the software, run the following command in your
virtual environment (on Unix and Unix-like systems)::

    source $HOME/.virtualenvs/pds-deep-archive/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pds.deeparchive

Or on Windows in PowerShell::

    .\pds\Scripts\activate.ps1
    pip install --upgrade pds.deeparchive

.. note::

    The same admonitions mentioned earlier about command line invocations also
    apply to the above examples.
